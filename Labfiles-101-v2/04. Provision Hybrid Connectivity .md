# Exercise 2: Provision Hybrid Connectivity

### Estimated Duration: 120 minutes

Contoso, a global manufacturing company, is in the process of digitally transforming its operations. As part of this initiative, Contoso has decided to adopt a hybrid cloud strategy to leverage the benefits of both on-premises and cloud resources. The company needs to establish hybrid connectivity between its on-premises data center and the Microsoft Azure cloud to enable seamless data exchange, application deployment, and disaster recovery. 

In this exercise, you will provision connectivity from on-premises to Azure via Site-to-Site VPN (S2S VPN), with static routing, and verify connectivity between on-premises and Azure. 

This lab will emulate an on-premises site using another separate VNet in Azure with a Virtual Network Gateway as the VPN device. 

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Configure Virtual WAN to connect to the on-premises environment
- Task 2: Configure the on-premises environment to connect to Azure
- Task 3: Create the VPN connection to on-premises
- Task 4: Validate Hybrid connectivity
  
## Task 1: Configure Virtual WAN to connect to the on-premises environment.

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **Public IP addresses  (1)**, then select **Public IP addresses  (2)** under **Services**.
