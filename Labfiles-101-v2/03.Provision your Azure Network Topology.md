# Exercise 1: Provision your Azure Network Topology (Platform and Application Landing Zone)

### Estimated Duration: 60 minutes

Contoso, a global technology company, has migrated its on-premises infrastructure to the Azure cloud to modernize its operations, improve scalability, and enhance security. Contoso needs to provision a comprehensive Azure Network Topology, including both the Platform and Application Landing Zone, to support its diverse workloads and applications as part of this digital transformation initiative.

In this exercise, you'll familiarize yourself with Virtual WAN, virtual Hub and Virtual Network connections for your workloads.

## Lab Objectives

You will be able to complete the following tasks:

- Task 1: Inspect the VM NIC effective routing
- Task 2: Connect Spoke vNets to Virtual WAN Hub
- Task 3: Verify routing on both Spoke VMs
  
## Task 1: Inspect the VM NIC effective routing. 

In this task, you will review effective route configurations of the Network Interface.

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **Network Interfaces (1)**, then select **Network Interfaces (2)** under **Services**.

## Task 2: Connect Spoke vNets to Virtual WAN Hub

In this task, you will be creating Virtual network connections to Virtual WAN Hub.

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **Virtual WANs (1)**, then click on **Virtual WANs (2)** under **Services**.

14. On the **Add Connection** page, enter the following values:

    - **Connection Name (1):** Enter **vwan-vnet-001**

    - **Hubs (2):** Select **vwan-hub-prod-001**

    - **Subscriptions (3):** Select your subscription
    
    - **Resource group (4):** Select **Prod-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group from the drop down list

    - **Virtual network (5):** Select **vnet-spoke1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
    - Under **propagate to none**, make sure its selected to **No (6)**
    - Click on **Create (7)**.

16. To add a second connection, click on **+ Add Connection** and enter the following values:

     - **Connection Name (1):** Enter **vwan-vnet-002**

     - **Hubs (2):** Select **vwan-hub-prod-001**

     - **Subscriptions (3):** Select your subscription
    
     - **Resource group (4):** Select **Prod-RG-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** resource group from the drop down list

     - **Virtual network (5):** Select **vnet-spoke2-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
       
     - Under **propogate to none**, make sure its selected to **No (6)**
       
     - Click on **Create (7)**.

1. After adding the creation, you receive a **Notifications (1)** stating **Successfully added peering (2)**.

     ![](./Media/102-ex2-9.png)

1. Go back to **vwan-prod-001 | Virtual network connection**, click on the drop-down symbol next to **Virtual network (1)**, you can see **vnet-spoke1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** and **vnet-spoke2-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)** created.

## Task 3: Verify routing on both Spoke VMs.

In this task, you will review effective route configurations of the Network Interface after creating virtual network connections to the VWAN hub.

1. In the search bar of the Azure portal, type **network Interfaces (1)**, then select **Network Interfaces (2)** under **Services**.

     ![](./Media/102-ex2-1.png)
     
1. Click on the **nic-spoke1-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** and then select **Effective routes (1)**, Click on the **Download (2)** to download the file with the routes. You will compare these routes in steps later.

     ![](./Media/102-ex2-2.png)

1. Compare the newly-downloaded file with the previously downloaded file prior to connecting the vNets to the Virtual WAN Hub.

   >**Note**: You should see new prefixes in the route list for 10.3.0.0/16 and 10.4.0.0/16. These represent the routes for the target networks where the VMs reside and were automatically programmed by adding connections in the Virtual WAN.
